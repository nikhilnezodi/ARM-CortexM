### ARM-CortexM

## ARM CPU Architectures
ARM makes architectures and sells them. Not Hardware. Other Semicon companies nxp,ti,stm implement the architecture and get the controllers manufactured.

ARM - A - class: Application grade (can run OS - Mac(M1,M2),Linux)
      R - class: Realtime systems (Engine control/management controller | cpu has to respond in realtime)
      M - class: Microcontroller based application (toaster, remote control, power window,etc. any single targeted small application)

M series is simple to understand and straight forward. 

# Micro Architecture vs Architecture
